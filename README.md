# bintable, latest release version:2.0.0

BIN lookup library.

NOTE: The owner of each credit or debit card is not the cardholder, but the card issuer or institution that has issued a credit card. 
BINList is a simple library for searching issuer Bank Identification Numbers (BIN) / Issuer Identification Numbers (IIN). The first 8 digits of a credit or debit card number represent the IIN, previously known as Bank Identification Number (BIN). These 8 numbers identify the institution that issued the card to the cardholder.

This library queries public REST API.
